# Paper-code
# 1. Overview

The code for the paper "Maximizing Innovation Performance in Technology Acquisitions through Ensemble Learning and Metaheuristic Algorithms". The repository is organized as follows:

- **data/**: Contains the sample of datasets used in the paper.
- **jupyter notebook/All Features Interaction.ipynb**: Uses multiple ensemble learning models based on feature interactions across the entire dataset.
- **jupyter notebook/Meta Interaction.ipynb**: Based on feature combination and interaction derived from five metaheuristic algorithms.
- **jupyter notebook/MI-RFE Interaction.ipynb**: Based on feature combination and interaction derived from Mutual Information and Recursive Feature Elimination methods.
