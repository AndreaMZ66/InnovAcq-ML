# Paper-code
1. Overview
The code for paper "Maximizing Innovation Performance in Technology Acquisitions through Ensemble Learning and Metaheuristic Algorithms". The repository is organized as follows:
data/ contains the sample of datasets used in the paper;
jupyter notebook/All Features Interaction.ipynb uses multiple ensemble learning models based on feature interactions across the entire dataset;
jupyter notebook/Meta Interaction.ipynb is based on feature combination and interaction derived from five metaheuristic algorithms;
jupyter notebook/MI-RFE Interaction .ipynb is based on feature combination and interaction derived from Mutual Information and Recursive Feature Elimination methods.
